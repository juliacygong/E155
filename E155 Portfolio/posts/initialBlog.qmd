 Hey everyone! I am currently taking E155 this fall, and I am very excited about all the different labs and projects I will be working on. Over the course of this semester, I want to develop more skills and knowledge working with FPGAs and microcontrollers. I currently have more experience with digital design, so I also want to become more comfortable with analog design as well.
