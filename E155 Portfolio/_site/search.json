    "text": "My name is Julia Gong, and I am a current junior engineering major at Harvey Mudd College. I did not come into college expecting to focus on hardware, but after taking a Digital Design and Computer Architecture course I found myself drawn to the logic and structure of how computers function from gate-level circuits to pipelined processors. I have always enjoyed creative, hands-on work, including pottery, embroidery, beadwork, so I really enjoyed the creative process of designing finite state machines and building systems that interact on the microarchitectural level. I am interested in work that brings together low level systems thinking with thoughtful design, and Iâ€™m continuing to explore where that intersection may lead!\nYou can find all my work and projects for E155 (Microprocessor System: Design & Applications) here!"
